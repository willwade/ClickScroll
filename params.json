{"name":"Clickscroll","body":"*ClickScroll*\r\n\r\nWith thanks to [Lee Baker](http://leecbaker.com/) who helped pull this little app together.  From a request of Simon Judge at the Barnsley AT service. \r\nPlease let me know (will AT e-wade.net) if you fork it or do anything fun with it\r\n\r\n**Download**\r\nTo download the Final Build [click here](https://github.com/downloads/willwade/ClickScroll/ClickScroll.zip)\r\n\r\n**Aim:**\r\nTo scroll the most foreground window with the Mouse/Pointer. \r\n\r\nSometimes the scroll bars are just too minimal, particularly in Lion (even if you [disable that feature](http://www.nightlion.net/reviews/osx/2011/how-to-enable-and-make-scrollbars-in-osx-lion-visible/). This app helps to provide individuals with limited control and movement the ability to use the scroll bars in whatever app they are in. \r\n\r\n**Usage**\r\nDownload (see below), Unzip and run.\r\nPlace in a corner of the screen and leave there. When you want to scroll a window click the up or down arrow. Double clicking jumps in larger increments. Single clicking in smaller ones\r\n\r\n\r\n**Bugs:**\r\nNot currently draggable with [dwellclicker](http://dwellclick.com) \r\n\r\n","tagline":"A small OSX app to help scroll windows with the mouse.
