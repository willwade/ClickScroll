*ClickScroll*

!['Image of app'](ClickScroll.png)

With thanks to [Lee Baker](http://leecbaker.com/) who helped pull this little app together.  From a request of Simon Judge at the Barnsley AT service. 
Please let me know (will AT e-wade.net) if you fork it or do anything fun with it

**Download**
To download the Final Build [click here](https://github.com/downloads/willwade/ClickScroll/ClickScroll.zip)

**Aim:**
To scroll the most foreground window with the Mouse/Pointer. 

Sometimes the scroll bars are just too minimal, particularly in Lion (even if you [disable that feature](http://www.nightlion.net/reviews/osx/2011/how-to-enable-and-make-scrollbars-in-osx-lion-visible/). This app helps to provide individuals with limited control and movement the ability to use the scroll bars in whatever app they are in. 

**Usage**
Download (see below), Unzip and run.
Place in a corner of the screen and leave there. When you want to scroll a window click the up or down arrow. Double clicking jumps in larger increments. Single clicking in smaller ones


**Bugs:**
Not currently draggable with [dwellclicker](http://dwellclick.com)
